Shapes you can move, in prototype form!

This is an early prototype of a project for [Revolution Hall Portland's](http://www.revolutionhallpdx.com/) Design Week.
The concept is to have users move around multiple shapes of the same (similar?, different?) color in order to make new
and interesting shapes. Like Tangrams!
